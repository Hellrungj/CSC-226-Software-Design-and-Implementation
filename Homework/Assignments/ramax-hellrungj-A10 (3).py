#It was a very challenging assignment. We changed our code three times until we
# got it to work. Our previous codes were smaller and more condense which allowed room
# for errors however making a longer code helped us go through each of the problems
# we have to fix for our html.

<h3>A Basic Web Page</h3>

<p>A basic web page looks something like this. It might have
images like:<br>

<img style="width: 66px; height: 44px;" alt="WC3 image" src="wc3.gif">
<br>
And it might have a line like:
